                Maryland publishes its budget story across three separate report types: the ACFR (Annual Comprehensive Financial Report), the MFR (Monthly Fiscal Report), and the JCR (Joint Chairmen&apos;s Report). Each contains narrative interpretations of the numbers, but no existing public tool has pulled those narratives together and checked them against the underlying audited financial statements.

              <p style={{ fontSize: 14, color: "var(--nxt-dark)", lineHeight: 1.75 }}>
                This tool does that. Where the narrative in one document claims an outcome that the financial data does not support, we flag it. Where narratives across the three report types converge, we present that convergence as a finding. This reconciliation layer is the core methodological contribution of this project.
